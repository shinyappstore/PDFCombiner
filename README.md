PDF Combiner is a comprehensive R Shiny application that serves as a fast, free, and secure alternative to expensive commercial software like Adobe Acrobat and privacy-compromising online services. This powerful web-based tool processes all files locally on your machine, ensuring complete privacy without requiring registration or file uploads to third-party servers. The application supports flexible upload options for both PDF and image files with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to upload multiple files simultaneously or individually and easily rearrange their order before combining. Advanced page-level control features include selective page removal using flexible syntax, page rotation in 90-degree increments, and a built-in PDF viewer for real-time preview and verification of changes. Additional processing capabilities encompass automatic password protection removal, lossless compression for file size optimization, and experimental format conversion.
